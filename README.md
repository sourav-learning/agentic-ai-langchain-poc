# BasicAgents Project -> placeEnquiry
This is an agent which invokes 2 tools add need. It has a list of cities with min/max temperature and sunrise and sunset timing. 
If an user gives the name of city or any place in the city, LLM will find the name of city, checks the details. If it finds the details it can response based on same.
If it cannot find the name of city or place, it will directly tell the same. 
The question need not be direct. A question like - What can be the best time to watch sunset from Gateway of India and what kind of dress can make me comfortable is answered very well.
